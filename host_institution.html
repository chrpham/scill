      <h3>Host Institutions</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>The SJSU SCILL consortium with the collaborative effort of Stanford University, UC Santa Cruz, The Parkinson’s Institute, Biotime, and Stem Cell Theranostics, prepare and train graduate-level students in stem cell research. The Host Institutions offer a diverse array of research interests in Regenerative Medicine with the state-of-the-art-technology. Each institution works closely with the interns to provide them with experience and laboratory skills that will allow them to take advantage of career opportunities in stem cell research.

        <h3>Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine Institute</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>The institute was established in 2003 to build on Stanford’s leadership in stem cell science and to set the foundations for the creation of a new field of science: regenerative medicine. Under the direction of renowned stem cell researcher Dr. Irving Weissman, the institute is devoted to exploring the how stem cells are created, the mechanisms by which they are regulated and how they devolve into specialized cells.</p>
        <p>The ultimate goal is to translate this knowledge into dramatic new medical therapies for some of the world’s most serious and intractable afflictions. Finally, as part of Stanford School of Medicine, the institute is dedicated to training the next generation of stem cell researchers.</p>

        <h3>Institute for the Biology of Stem Cells</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Stem cell research at University of California, Santa Cruz, focuses on the basic biological systems operating in the processes of self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells.</p>
        <p>Stem cells hold great promise for curing or mitigating the effects of many diseases and injuries. But before a single clinical trial can commence, basic research must take place to uncover the pathways, mechanisms, and cellular effects of potential stem-cell-based cures. Basic research is also needed to overcome technological hurdles, such as how to ensure that stem cells work effectively when injected into a living organism. Investment in basic research of the kind done at the IBSC is an essential step toward stem-cell-based cures. </p>
        <p>The Center for Biomolecular Science & Engineering administers the UCSC Institute for the Biology of Stem Cells</p>

        <p>Escape Therapeutics, Inc is an early stage biotechnology company focused on accelerating the commercial availability of allogeneic stem cell therapies by solving the key translational hurdle preventing their clinical utility – immune mismatch and subsequent donor rejection.</p>
        <p>Invented by Escape's founder Dr. Hantash while at Stanford University, the Company's platform technology represents a significant potential breakthrough that can revolutionize the treatment of blood-borne disorders such as leukemia, HIV, and autoimmune diseases. Escape's innovative technology allows for the creation of the world's first allogeneic, "off-the-shelf" therapy capable of being used in any patient irrespective of their HLA profile.</p>
        <p>Escape's mission is to transform healthcare through innovating cures rather than band-aid medicines. Escape will be the first company worldwide to enable cell-based therapeutics to achieve a universal, off-the-shelf status.</p>

        <p>Founded in 1988, The Parkinson’s Institute and Clinical Center (PI) is America’s only independent non-profit organization that provides basic and clinical research, clinical trials and a comprehensive movement disorder patient clinic for Parkinson’s disease (PD) and related neurological movement disorders, all under one roof. Our mission is to find the causes, provide first class patient care and discover a cure. Our unique freestanding organization supports a strong collaboration of translational medicine designed to more directly connect research to patient care – from the "bench to bedside".</p>
