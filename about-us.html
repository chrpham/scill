        <h2>Program Overview</h2>
    The SJSU SCILL program is a two-year program leading to an M.A./M.S. Biological Sciences or an MBT degree. The curriculum is designed to equip students with broad-based understanding of stem cell biology through classroom instruction and seminars, and in-depth, laboratory. The program is customized to each student's goals through elective classes and laboratory project.</p>
    <p>More than 60 stem cell researchers from our consortium partners’ institutions are committed to educating and training students for careers in stem cell biology. Each SJSU SCILL student will have diverse internship opportunities in basic cell and molecular research at our research university partners (Stanford University and UC Santa Cruz), translations research involving stem cell product development at our corporate partner (Escape Therapeutics, Inc.), and clinical applications of stem cell science at the Parkinson's Institute.</p>
    <p>On the successful completion of the curriculum and SJSU SCILL internship, students are awarded a master's degree and are prepared for a career in stem cell biology. </p><br />
<h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Consortium for Stem Cell Internships in laboratory-based Learning was formed by faculty and administrators from five institutions who made a commitment to educate and to train students at the graduate level for careers in stem cell biology and to increase awareness about scientific and societal issues related to stem cell biology and regenerative medicine among non-science majors. </p>

      <p>San Jose State is one of the eleven California State University Campuses recently awarded a total of $16 million by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine. SJSU received $1.73 million and is partnered with Escape Therapeutics, The Parkinson’s Institute, Stanford University, and the University of California, Santa Cruz, to provide students with the academic and practical experience they need to pursue careers involving stem cell research. </p> 

      <p>This CIRM-supported program, endorsed by the leaders in the stem cell arena, will ensure that California will continue to lead the nation in a providing regional stem cell workforce of the highest quality. </p> <br />


        <p><h2>Vision & Goals </h2></p>
        <br />
         <img src="images/content__images/research.jpg" alt="image" class="img-responsive"> <br />
        <p>The primary goal of the San Jos&eacute; State University Consortium for Stem Cell Internships in Laboratory-based Learning (SJSU SCILL) is to provide the State of California and the central coast region with well-educated scientists who are proficient in stem cell biology at the graduate level.</p>
        <p>The second goal is to increase awareness about scientific and societal issues related to stem cell biology and regenerative medicine among non-science majors.</p>
        <p>These two goals enable us to provide stem cell biology training and education to our culturally and ethnically diverse student population. Students are prepared for careers in stem cell biology and regenerative medicine through SJSU SCILL Program.</p>
        <p><h3><strong>Proficiency in Stem Cell Biology</strong></p></h3>
        <p>The state of California is in urgent need for therapies for a variety of degenerative diseases. Developments in stem cell biology are on the verge of providing such therapies. The process of translating research-based innovations into useful, proven patient therapies is complex, and requires professionals at various levels. In creating CIRM the voters in California ascended to a leadership position in developing stem cells for therapeutic applications. </p>
        <p>Through CIRM funding, the Stem Cell Internships in Laboratory-based Learning Program at San Jos&eacute; State University (SJSU SCILL) continues to generate well-rounded professionals who will accelerate the development of stem cells therapies. We train California State University students who will provide the engine supporting California's stem cell industry. </p>
        <p>We partner with premier institutions in the San Francisco Bay Area to train high quality professionals in basic cell and molecular research, translational research involving stem cell product development and clinical applications of stem cell science.</p>
        <p>We also train our students to understand the people in need of stem cell therapies by engaging them in patient care at degenerative disease clinics and institutes for translational medicine. Our students will also reach out to their communities to educate wide audiences about stem cell sources and their pathway to therapeutic applications. 
        Furthermore, SCILL provides young people of California from diverse backgrounds with a university master’s degree in science and career opportunities in this expanding California industry. </p>
