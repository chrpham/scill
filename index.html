				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists from the Gladstone Institutes have done it again. They’ve made a better and faster way of generating healthy heart tissue in mice with damaged hearts. With further advancements, their findings could potentially be translated into a new way of treating heart failure in patients.</p>
<p>Previously, the Gladstone team discovered that they could transform scar tissue in the damaged hearts of mice into healthy, beating heart muscle cells by a process called direct reprogramming. The team found that turning on three transcription factors, Gata4, Mef2c and Tbx5 (collectively called GMT), in the damaged hearts of mice activated heart genes that turned scar tissue cells, also known as cardiac fibroblasts, into beating heart cells or cardiomyocytes.</p>
<p>Their GMT direct cardiac reprogramming technology was only able to turn 10 percent of cardiac fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes in mice over the period of six to eight week. In their new CIRM-funded study published in <em>Circulation</em>, they improved upon their original reprogramming method by identifying two chemicals that improved the efficiency of making new heart cells. Not only were they able to create eight times the number of beating cardiomyocytes from mouse cardiac fibroblasts, but they were also able to speed up the reprogramming process to a period of just one week.</p>
<p>To find these chemicals, they screened a library of 5,500 small molecules. The chemicals that looked most promising for cardiac reprogramming were inhibitors of the TGF-β and WNT signaling pathways. The importance of these chemicals was explained in a <a href="https://gladstone.org/about-us/news/scientists-create-heart-cells-better-faster-stronger" target="_blank">Gladstone news release</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The first chemical inhibits a growth factor that helps cells grow and divide and is important for repairing tissue after injury. The second chemical inhibits an important pathway that regulates heart development. By combining the two chemicals with GMT, the researchers successfully regenerated heart muscle and greatly improved heart function in mice that had suffered a heart attack.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Senior author on the study, Deepak Srivastava, further explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>“While our original process for direct cardiac reprogramming with GMT has been promising, it could be more efficient. With our screen, we discovered that chemically inhibiting two biological pathways active in embryonic formation improves the speed, quantity, and quality of the heart cells produced from our original process.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Encouraged by their studies in mice, the scientists also tested their new and improved direct reprogramming method on human cells. Previously they found that while the same GMT transcription factors could reprogram human cardiac fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes, a combination of seven factors was required to make quality cardiomyocytes comparable to those seen in mice. But with the addition of the two inhibitors, they were able to reduce the number of reprogramming factors from seven to four, which included the GMT factors and one additional factor called Myocardin. These four factors plus the two chemical inhibitors were capable of reprograming human cardiac fibroblasts into beating heart cells.</p>
<p>With heart failure affecting more than 20 million people globally, the need for new therapies that can regenerate the heart is pressing. The Gladstone team is hoping to advance their research to a point where it could be tested in human patients with heart failure. First author on the study, Tamer Mohamed, concluded:</p>
<p>“Heart failure afflicts many people worldwide, and we still do not have an effective treatment for patients suffering from this disease. With our enhanced method of direct cardiac reprogramming, we hope to combine gene therapy with drugs to create better treatments for patients suffering from this devastating disease.”</p>

<p><a href="https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/novemberawarenessmonth.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-10137 alignright" src="https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/novemberawarenessmonth.jpg?w=300&#038;h=216" alt="novemberawarenessmonth" width="300" height="216" srcset="https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/novemberawarenessmonth.jpg?w=300&amp;h=216 300w, https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/novemberawarenessmonth.jpg?w=150&amp;h=108 150w, https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/novemberawarenessmonth.jpg 376w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>This week in honor of Diabetes Awareness Month, we are featuring type 1 diabetes (T1D), a chronic disease that destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in your pancreas. Without these important cells, patients cannot maintain the proper levels of glucose, a fancy name for sugar, in their blood and are at risk for many complications including heart disease, blindness, and even death.</p>
<p>Cell replacement therapy is evolving into an attractive option for patients with T1D. Replacing lost beta cells in the pancreas is a more permanent and less burdensome solution than the daily insulin shots (or insulin pumps) that many T1D patients currently take.</p>
<p>So let’s take a look at the past year’s advances in stem cell research for diabetes.</p>
<p><strong>Making Insulin-Producing Cells from Stem Cells and Skin</strong></p>
<p>This year, there were a lot of exciting studies that improved upon previous methods for generating pancreatic beta cells in a dish. Here’s a brief recap of a few of the studies we covered on our blog:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://blog.cirm.ca.gov/2016/05/11/scientists-make-insulin-secreting-cells-from-stem-cells-of-type-1-diabetes-patients/" target="_blank">Make pancreatic cells from stem cells</a>. </strong>Scientists from the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and the Harvard Stem Cell Institute developed a method that makes beta cells from T1D patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that behave very similarly to true beta cells both in a dish and when transplanted into diabetic mice. Their discovery has the potential to offer personalized stem cell treatments for patients with T1D in the near future and the authors of the study predicted that their technology could be ready to test in humans in the next three to five years.</li>
</ul>

The pancreatic cells looked and acted like the real thing in a dish (they were able to secrete insulin when exposed to glucose), and they functioned normally when transplanted into diabetic mice. This study is exciting because it offers a new and more efficient method to make functioning human beta cells in mass quantities.

<li><strong><a href="https://blog.cirm.ca.gov/2016/10/03/from-pig-parts-to-stem-cells-scientist-douglas-melton-wins-ogawa-yamanaka-prize-for-work-on-diabetes/" target="_blank">Challenges of stem cell-derived diabetes treatments</a>. </strong>At this year’s Ogawa-Yamanaka Stem Cell Award ceremony Douglas Melton, a well-renowned diabetes researcher from Harvard, spoke about the main challenges for developing stem cell-derived diabetes treatments. The first is the need for better control over the methods that make beta cells from stem cells. The second was finding ways to make large quantities of beta cells for human transplantation. The last was finding ways to prevent a patient’s immune system from rejecting transplanted beta cells. Melton and other scientists are already working on improving techniques to make more beta cells from stem cells. As for preventing transplanted beta cells from being attacked by the patient’s immune system, Melton described two possibilities: using an encapsulation device or biological protection to mask the transplanted cells from an attack.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Progress to a Cure: Clinical Trials for Type 1 Diabetes</strong></p>
<p>Speaking of encapsulation devices, CIRM is funding a Phase I clinical trial sponsored by a San Diego-based company called <a href="http://viacyte.com/" target="_blank">ViaCyte</a> that’s hoping to develop a stem cell-based cure for patients with T1D. The treatment involves placing a small encapsulated device containing stem cell-derived pancreatic precursor cells under the skin of T1D patients. Once implanted, these precursor cells should develop into pancreatic beta cells that can secrete insulin into the patient’s blood stream. The goal of this trial is first to make sure the treatment is safe for patients and second to see if it’s effective in improving a patient’s ability to regulate their blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>To learn more about this exciting clinical trial, watch this fun video made by Youreka Science.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='549' height='452' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q6U5kf5ByNE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></div></p>
<p>ViaCyte is still waiting on results for their Phase 1 clinical trial, but in the meantime, they are developing a modified version of their original device for T1D called PEC-Direct. This device also contains pancreatic precursor cells but it’s been designed in a way that allows the patient’s blood vessels to make direct connections to the cells inside the device. This vascularization process hopefully will improve the survival and function of the insulin producing beta cells inside the device. This study, which is in the last stage of research before clinical trials, <a href="https://blog.cirm.ca.gov/2016/07/21/cirm-board-targets-diabetes-and-kidney-disease-with-big-stem-cell-research-awards/" target="_blank">is also being funded by CIRM</a>, and we are excited to hear news about its progress next year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The results are in folks. Though it’s too early to declare a winner, it looks very likely that sickle cell disease is going to be soundly defeated by CRISPR-Cas9.</p>
<p>Reporting in <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature20134.html"><em>Nature</em></a> on Monday, Stanford researchers devised a method to efficiently correct the sickle cell mutation in human blood stem cells using the super-popular, user-friendly CRISPR-Cas9 genetic editing technology. Speaking to <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-gene-editing-crispr-idUKKBN13300A"><em>Reuters</em></a>, lead scientist Matthew Porteus forecasted that clinical trials are just around the corner:</p>

<p>We think we have a complete data set to present to the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) to say we&#8217;ve done all pre-clinical experiments to show this is ready for a clinical trial</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Sickle Cell Disease 101<br />
</strong>Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder that causes the generation of abnormal, sickle-shaped red blood cells in people afflicted with the disease. As a result, the misshapen cells become sticky and clump up inside blood vessels which can cause debilitating pain, anemia and organ failure. Besides pain medicine and frequent blood transfusions, the only other treatment available is a blood stem cell transplant which can be curative but carries significant risks including a high mortality rate.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_10114" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10114" src="https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/sickled-rbcs-960x480.png?w=676" alt="sickled-rbcs-960x480" srcset="https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/sickled-rbcs-960x480.png?w=676 676w, https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/sickled-rbcs-960x480.png?w=150 150w, https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/sickled-rbcs-960x480.png?w=300 300w, https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/sickled-rbcs-960x480.png?w=768 768w, https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/sickled-rbcs-960x480.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px"   /><p class="wp-caption-text">Sickle cell disease leads to abnormally shaped red blood cells (<a href="https://www.cirm.ca.gov/our-progress/video/defeating-sickle-cell-disease-stem-cells-gene-therapy">watch our video for more info</a>)</p></div>
<p>Because the disease arises from a single DNA mutation, scientists have been working hard to use gene editing techniques as a treatment strategy. In this procedure, the patient’s stem cells are collected from their bone marrow and then the mutation is corrected in the lab. The repaired cells are transplanted back into the patient which avoids risk of immune rejection due to mismatched donor blood.</p>
<p><strong>CRISPR-Cas9: the New Kid in Gene Therapy Town<br />
</strong>Other gene therapy techniques have been successful at fixing the sickle cell mutation and are currently in clinical trials. But the more recent CRISPR-Cas9 method is much easier to carry out. Cas9 is an enzyme with an attached piece of RNA, a genetic molecule, that can be engineered to bind specifically to the sickle cell gene and, like molecular scissors, snip the DNA. This break in the DNA activates the cell’s natural DNA repair functions. At the same time, the correct sickle cell gene is delivered to the stem cells with the help of a harmless virus.</p>
<p>The researchers were able to correct 30 to 50% of the mutated cells using this method. That’s well over the 10% threshold that’s thought to be needed to get a clinical benefit in people. And 16 weeks after transplanting the cells into mice, the cells were still intact and healthy in the animal’s bone marrow. Just a few weeks ago, a group at UC Berkeley reported <a href="http://www.fiercebiotech.com/research/crispr-a-potential-cure-for-sickle-cell-disease">a slightly different CRISPR-Cas9 method</a> to correct the sickle cell gene and found that about 25% of cells were corrected.</p>
<p>According to the Reuters interview, Porteus hopes to begin clinical trials in 2018. Add that to the sickle cell gene therapy trials already underway, including a <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02247843">CIRM-funded trial</a> sponsored by UCLA, and you can’t help feeling optimistic that sickle cell disease will be voted out of the existence in the not so distance future.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10110/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10110/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10110/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10110/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10110/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10110/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10110/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10110/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10110/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10110/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10110/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10110/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.cirm.ca.gov&#038;blog=68067291&#038;post=10110&#038;subd=aholdencirm&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>There comes a pivotal point in every experiment where you say “ok, now we are going to see if this really works.” We may be at that point in the clinical trial we are funding to see if stem cells can help people with spinal cord injuries.</p>
<p>Today <a href="https://www.cirm.ca.gov/our-progress/disease-information/spinal-cord-injury-fact-sheet">Asterias Biotherapeutics</a> announced they have given the first patient in the clinical trial the highest dose of 20 million cells. The therapy was administered at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center (SCVMC) in San Jose, California where Jake Javier – a young man who was treated at an earlier stage of the trial – was treated. You can read <a href="https://blog.cirm.ca.gov/2016/07/12/stem-cell-transplant-offers-jake-a-glimpse-of-hope/">Jake’s story here</a>.</p>
<p>The goal of the trial is to test the safety of transplanting three escalating doses of AST-OPC1 cells. These are a form of cell called oligodendrocyte progenitors, which are capable of becoming several different kinds of nerve cells, some of which play a supporting role and help protect nerve cells in the central nervous system – the area damaged in spinal cord injury.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://asteriasbiotherapeutics.com/asterias-biotherapeutics-announces-treatment-of-first-spinal-cord-injury-patient-with-maximum-dose-of-ast-opc1-in-scistar-clinical-trial/">news release</a>, Dr. Edward Wirth, Asterias’ Chief Medical Officer, says this could be a crucial phase in the trial:</p>
<p>“We have been very encouraged by the early clinical efficacy and safety data for AST-OPC1, and we now look forward to evaluating the 20 million cell dose in complete cervical spinal cord injury patients. Based on extensive pre-clinical research, this is in the dosing range where we would expect to see optimal clinical improvement in these patients.”</p>
<p>To be eligible, individuals have to have experienced a severe neck injury in the last 30 days, one that has left them with no sensation or movement below the level of their injury, and that means they have typically lost all lower limb function and most hand and arm function.</p>
<p>In the first phase individuals were given 2 million cells. This was primarily to make sure that this approach was safe and wouldn’t cause any problems for the patients. The second phase boosted that dose to ten million cells. That was thought to be about half the therapeutic dose but it seemed to help all those enrolled. By 90 days after the transplant all five patients treated with ten million cells had shown some level of recovery of at least one motor level, meaning they had regained some use of their arms and/or hands on at least one side of their body. Two of the patients experienced an improvement of two motor levels. Perhaps the most impressive was <a href="https://blog.cirm.ca.gov/2016/09/07/young-man-with-spinal-cord-injury-regains-use-of-hands-and-arms-after-stem-cell-therapy/">Kris Boesen</a>, who regained movement and strength in both his arms and hands. He says he is even experiencing some movement in his legs.</p>
<p>All this is, of course, tremendously encouraging, but we also have to sound a note of caution. Sometimes individuals experience spontaneous recovery after an accident like this. The fact that all five patients in the 10 million cell group did well suggests that this may be more than just a coincidence. That’s why this next group, the 20 million cell cohort, is so important.</p>
<p>As Steve McKenna, Chief of the Trauma Center at SCVMC, says; if we are truly going to see an improvement in people’s condition because of the stem cell transplant, this is when we would expect to see it:</p>
<p>“The early efficacy results presented in September from the 10 million cell AIS-A cohort were quite encouraging, and we’re looking forward to seeing if those meaningful functional improvements are maintained through six months and beyond. We are also looking forward to seeing the results in patients from the higher 20 million cell AST-OPC1 dose, as well as results in the first AIS-B patients.”</p>

<p>Someone stole my thigh bone. One minute it was there. The next, gone. I have narrowed down the list of suspects to the more than 25,000 people attending <a href="http://www.bayareascience.org/discovery-days/">Discovery Day</a> at San Francisco’s AT&amp;T Park.</p>
<p>To be honest, the bone was just a laminated image of a bone, stuck to the image of a person drawn on a white board. We were using it, along with laminated images of a brain, liver, stomach and other organs and tissues, to show that there are many different kinds of stem cells in the body, and they all have different potential uses.</p>
<p>The white board and its body parts were gimmicks that we used to get kids to come up to the CIRM booth and ask what we were doing. Then, as they played with the images, and tried to guess which stem cells went where, we talked to their parents about stem cell research, and CIRM and the progress being made.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_10093" style="width: 686px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10093" src="https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/discoveryday-karen.jpg?w=676&#038;h=1014" alt="discoveryday-karen" srcset="https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/discoveryday-karen.jpg?w=676&amp;h=1014 676w, https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/discoveryday-karen.jpg?w=100&amp;h=150 100w, https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/discoveryday-karen.jpg?w=200&amp;h=300 200w, https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/discoveryday-karen.jpg?w=768&amp;h=1152 768w, https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/discoveryday-karen.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px"   /><p class="wp-caption-text">Dr. Karen Ring explaining embryonic development to kids</p></div>
<p>We also used Play Doh so that the kids could model cell division and specialization during embryonic development. But mostly it was so the kids could play with the Play Doh while we talked to their parents.</p>
<p>It is shameless I know but when you are competing against more than 130 other booths for people’s attention – and some of these booths had live snakes, virtual reality devices, or they just let kids throw and hit things – you have to be creative.</p>
<p>And creativity was certainly the key word, because Discovery Day – part of the annual week-long Bay Area Science Fair – was filled with booths from companies and academic institutions promoting every imaginable aspect of science.</p>
<p>So why were we there? Well, first, education has been an important part of CIRM’s mission ever since we were created. Second, we’re a state agency that gets public funding so we feel we owe it to the public to explain how their money is being used. And third, it’s just a lot of fun.</p>
<p>NASA was there, talking about exploring deep space. And there were booths focused on exploring the oceans, and saving them from pollution and over-fishing. You could learn about mathematics and engineering by building wacky-looking paper airplanes that flew long distances, or you could just sit in the cockpit of a fighter jet.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10097" src="https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/discoveryday-victor.jpg?w=676" alt="discoveryday-victor" srcset="https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/discoveryday-victor.jpg?w=676 676w, https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/discoveryday-victor.jpg?w=1352 1352w, https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/discoveryday-victor.jpg?w=150 150w, https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/discoveryday-victor.jpg?w=300 300w, https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/discoveryday-victor.jpg?w=768 768w, https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/discoveryday-victor.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px"   /></p>
<p>And everywhere you looked were families, with kids running up to the different booths to see what was there. All they needed was a little draw to get them to stick around for a few minutes, so you could talk to them and explain to them what stem cells are and why they are so amazing. Some of the kids were fascinated and wanted to know more: some just wanted to use the Play Doh;  at least one just wanted to eat the Play Doh, but fortunately we were able to stop that happening.</p>
<p>It was an amazing sight to see a baseball stadium filled with tens of thousands of people, all there to learn about science. At a time when we are told that kids don’t care about science, that they don’t like math, this was the perfect response. All you had to do was look around and see that kids were fascinated by science. They were hungry to learn how pouring carbon dioxide on a candle puts out the flame. They delighted in touching an otter pelt and feeling how silky smooth it is, and then looking at the pelt under a microscope to see just how extraordinarily dense the hairs are and how that helps waterproof the otter.</p>
<p>And so yes, we used Play Doh and a white board person to lure the kids to us. But it worked.</p>
<p>There was another booth where they had a couple of the San Francisco 49er’s cheerleaders in full uniform. I don’t actually know what that had to do with teaching science but it was very popular with some of the men. Maybe next year I could try dressing up like that. It would certainly draw a crowd.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10084/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10084/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10084/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10084/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10084/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10084/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10084/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10084/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10084/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10084/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10084/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10084/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.cirm.ca.gov&#038;blog=68067291&#038;post=10084&#038;subd=aholdencirm&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Amy Schumer and Paul Shaffer raise money for MS. (<em>Karen Ring</em>)<br />
</strong>Two famous individuals, one a comedian/movie star, the other a well-known musician, have combined forces to raise money for an important cause. Amy Schumer and Paul Shaffer have pledged to raise $2.5 million dollars to help support research into multiple sclerosis (MS). This disease affects the nerve cells in both the brain and spinal cord. It eats away at the protective myelin sheaths that coat and protect nerve cells and allow them to relay signals between the brain and the rest of the body. As a result, patients experience a wide range of symptoms including physical, mental and psychiatric problems.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_10030" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10030" src="https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/1507_schumer1.png?w=676" alt="1507_schumer1" srcset="https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/1507_schumer1.png 400w, https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/1507_schumer1.png?w=150 150w, https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/1507_schumer1.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"   /><p class="wp-caption-text">Comedian Amy Schumer and her Dad who has MS.<br />(<a href="http://www.nationalmssociety.org/About-the-Society/News/Meet-Amy-Schumer-Comedian,-Writer,-Actor-and-MS-Ac">National MS Society</a>)</p></div>
<p>The jury is still out on the exact cause of MS and there is no cure available. But the Tisch MS Research Center of New York is trying to change that. It is “dedicated to finding the cause and cure for MS” and recently announced, at its annual Future Without MS Gala, that it has pledged to raise $10 million to fund the stem cell research efforts ongoing at the Center. Currently, Tisch is “the only center with an FDA approved stem cell clinical trial for MS in the United States.” You can read more about this clinical trial, which is transplanting mesenchymal stem cell-derived brain progenitor cells into the spinal cord, on the <a href="http://tischms.org/repair-strategies-ms">Tisch website</a>.</p>
<p>At the gala, both Amy Schumer and Paul Shaffer were present to show their support for MS research. In an interview with <em><a href="http://people.com/books/amy-schumer-talks-being-an-introvert/">People</a></em> magazine, Amy revealed that her father struggles with MS. She explained, “Some days he’s really good and he’s with it and we’re joking around. And some days I go to visit my dad and it’s so painful. I can’t believe it.” Her experience watching her dad battle with MS inspired her to write and star in the movie <a href="http://www.trainwreckmovie.com/">TRAINWRECK</a>, and also to get involved in supporting MS research. “If I can help at all I’m gonna try, even if that means I’ll get hurt,” she said.</p>
<p><strong>Stem cells may help traumatic brain injuries (<em>Kevin McCormack</em>) <em><br />
</em></strong>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a huge problem in the US. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention around 1.7 million Americans suffer a TBI every year; 250,000 of those are serious enough to result in a hospitalization; 52,000 are fatal. Even those who survive a TBI are often left with permanent disabilities, caused by swelling in the brain that destroys brain cells.</p>
<p>Now researchers at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston say using a person’s own stem cells could help reduce the severity of a TBI.</p>
<p>The study, published in the journal <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/stem.2538/full">Stem Cells</a>, found that taking stem cells from a person’s own bone marrow and then re-infusing them into the bloodstream, within 48 hours of the injury, can help reduce the swelling and inflammation that damages the brain.</p>
<p>In an interview with the <a href="http://www.houstonchronicle.com/local/prognosis/article/Houston-researchers-use-stem-cells-to-treat-10483202.php">Houston Chronicle</a> Charles Cox, the lead researcher &#8211; and a member of CIRM’s Grants Working Group panel of experts – says the results are not a cure but they are encouraging:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m talking about the difference between someone who recovers to the point that they can take care of themselves, and someone who is totally dependent on someone else for even simple tasks, like using the bathroom and bathing.

<p><strong>Schizophrenia: an imbalance of brain cell types?<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder with a wide range of disabling symptoms such as delusional thoughts, hearing voices, anxiety and an inability to experience pleasure. It’s estimated that half of those with schizophrenia abuse drugs and alcohol, which likely contributes to increased incidence of unemployment, homelessness and suicide. No cure exists for the disorder because scientists don’t fully understand what causes it, and available treatments only mask the symptoms.</p>

<p>This week, researchers at the RIKEN Brain Science Institute in Japan reported new clues about what goes wrong at a cellular and molecular level in the brains of people with schizophrenia. The scientists created induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from healthy donors, as well as patients with schizophrenia, and then changed or specialized them into nerve cells, or neurons. They found that fewer iPSCs developed into neurons when comparing the cells from people with schizophrenia to the healthy donor cells. Instead, more iPSCs specialized into astrocytes, another type of brain cell. This fewer neurons/more astrocytes shift was also seen in brains of deceased donors who had schizophrenia.</p>
<p>Looking inside the cells, the researchers found higher levels of a protein called p38 in the neurons derived from the people with schizophrenia. Inhibiting the activity of p38 led to increased number of neurons and fewer astrocytes, which resembles the healthy state. These results, published in Translational Psychiatry and picked up by <a href="http://www.healthcanal.com/brain-nerves/brain-diseases/schizophrenia/75396-schizophrenic-stem-cells-do-not-differentiate-properly-into-neurons.html">Health Canal</a>, point to inhibitors of p38 activity as a potential path for developing new treatments.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10033/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10033/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10033/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10033/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10033/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10033/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10033/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10033/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10033/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10033/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10033/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10033/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.cirm.ca.gov&#038;blog=68067291&#038;post=10033&#038;subd=aholdencirm&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><em>Today we&#8217;re featuring a guest blog by Lisa Willemse about the <a href="http://www.cvent.com/events/2016-till-mcculloch-meetings/event-summary-8fa39ab03700402ab65f05134f1549d1.aspx" target="_blank">Till and McCulloch Stem Cell Meeting</a> in Canada. Enjoy!</em></p>
<p>Stem cell treatments should be incredibly easy. Or rather, that’s what some clinics or products would have you believe. Because, on the surface, a one-stop-shop for injectable cells to cure just about any condition or topical creams to peel away the scourge of time are very easy.</p>
<p>Attend one stem cell research conference and you’ll be convinced that it’s much more complicated. It’s a sea of reagents and transcription factors and unknown cause-and-effect. Many researchers will spend their entire career working on just one unknown and their caution and concern when it comes to the notion of a cure is justifiable.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_10024" style="width: 221px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/whistercreek.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-10024" src="https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/whistercreek.jpg?w=211&#038;h=300" alt="Whistler (Courtesy of Lisa Willemse)" width="211" height="300" srcset="https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/whistercreek.jpg?w=211&amp;h=300 211w, https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/whistercreek.jpg?w=422&amp;h=600 422w, https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/whistercreek.jpg?w=106&amp;h=150 106w" sizes="(max-width: 211px) 100vw, 211px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Whistler (Courtesy of Lisa Willemse)</p></div>
<p>Which makes it all the more impactful when you attend a research conference and hear three talks, back-to-back, that demonstrate that we’re ticking off some of those unknowns and getting much closer to real – not sham – therapies. Therapies with a sound scientific basis that are well planned and done with patient safety (not sales) in mind. Last week’s Till and McCulloch Meetings, held in Whistler, British Columbia gave us a sense of what is possible for three conditions: macular degeneration (vision), septic shock and a rare neurologic disease (Stiff Person Syndrome). Other blogs have covered  different aspects of this meeting <a href="http://www.signalsblog.ca/?s=TMM2016&amp;Submit=Search" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.ipscell.com/2016/11/multiple-filters-stem-cell-research-canadian-stem-cell-conference/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Vision Repair – Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)</strong></p>
<p>As the world’s first clinical trial to use induced pluripotent stem cells launched amid sweeping regulatory changes in Japan, <a href="http://www.cdb.riken.jp/en/research/laboratory/takahashi.html" target="_blank">Dr. Masayo Takahashi</a>’s treatment protocol for AMD has received no small amount of scrutiny. After a brief <a href="http://www.ipscell.com/2016/06/good-stem-cell-news-as-takahashi-ips-cell-trial-to-resume/" target="_blank">hiatus</a>, the trial was back on track earlier this year and Takahashi’s presentation at this meeting was highly anticipated.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_4746" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/ogawaaward-0782.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4746" src="https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/ogawaaward-0782.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="Dr. Masayo Takahashi" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/ogawaaward-0782.jpg?w=300&amp;h=200 300w, https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/ogawaaward-0782.jpg?w=600&amp;h=400 600w, https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/ogawaaward-0782.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dr. Masayo Takahashi</p></div>
<p>It did not disappoint. Takahashi spent the better part of her time outlining the steps taken to reach the point where the clinical trial was possible, including multiple studies in mice and further refinement of the treatment to ensure it would be stable in humans even with genetic changes over time. Given that one of the reasons the trial was put on hold was due to genetic mutations found in the cells prepared for the second potential human transplant, Takahashi’s careful work in ensuring the product was safe bodes well for the future of this trial.</p>
<p>The first patient was treated in 2014, a 78-year-old woman with wet AMD in the right eye, and although only minimal visual improvement was documented, the patient <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/10/02/national/science-health/first-ips-cell-transplant-patient-makes-progress-one-year/#.WBoDG_krK03" target="_blank">anonymously told the <em>Japan Times</em></a>, “I’m glad I received the treatment. I feel my eyesight has brightened and widened.”</p>
<p>Takahashi also alluded to some of the other challenges she’d had to overcome to make this trial a reality, including would-be critics who told her that the nervous system and the retina were too complicated to regenerate. Takahashi’s response? “You don’t know stem cells [and] you don’t understand the needs of the patient.”</p>
<p>While it was unclear when the next patient will receive treatment, Takahashi did say that three new applications for clinical trials using her refined protocols have been submitted for approval.</p>
<p><strong>Septic shock  </strong></p>
<p>Septic shock is not a condition that gets a lot of attention, most likely because it’s not a primary illness, but a secondary one; a drastic and often fatal immune response that severely reduces blood pressure and cell metabolism. It accounts for 20% of all intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and is the most common cause of non-coronary mortality in the ICU. For those who survive septic shock, there are significant and long-term health consequences.</p>
<p>Over 100 clinical trials have attempted to improve outcomes for patients with septic shock, but not one has been successfully translated into the clinical setting. Supportive care remains the mainstay of therapy.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_10025" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/profile_20160208-082106.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-10025" src="https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/profile_20160208-082106.jpg?w=676" alt="Dr. Lauralyn McIntyre" srcset="https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/profile_20160208-082106.jpg 250w, https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/profile_20160208-082106.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dr. Lauralyn McIntyre</p></div>
<p>This was the sober backdrop painted by critical care physician, <a href="http://www.ohri.ca/profile/lmcintyre" target="_blank">Dr. Lauralyn McIntyre</a> as she began her talk on the world’s first stem cell clinical trial for septic shock she is co-leading in Ottawa with Dr. Duncan Stewart.</p>
<p>Like Takahashi, McIntyre spent a good deal of time explaining the rationale and research that underpin the trial, which takes advantage of the immune-modulating properties of mesenchymal stromal cells (also called mesenchymal stem cells or MSCs) to suppress and reverse the effects of septic shock. This work includes reviews of more than 50 studies that looked at the effects of MSCs in both human trials and animal studies.</p>
<p>McIntyre also discussed research she did with mice in 2010 as a proof-of-concept, where the MSC therapy was delayed for six days. This delay is important as it better simulates the time frame in which most patients arrive in the hospital. As McIntryre pointed out, if the therapy only worked when given within hours of disease development, what good would it be for patients who come in on day six?</p>
<p>Fortunately, the therapy worked in the mice, even after a delayed timeframe, providing a green light for safety testing in humans. The <a href="http://oirm.ca/oirm-news-events/treating-septic-shock-where-stem-cell-research-meets-critical-care-medicine" target="_blank">small first human trial is currently underway</a> for nine patients (with a control arm of 21) with results not yet published – although one of the patients <a href="http://www.ohri.ca/newsroom/newsstory.asp?ID=756" target="_blank">shared his experience</a> earlier this year. McIntyre relayed that the early data is very encouraging – enough that the team is moving ahead with a Phase 2 randomized trial in 10 centres across Canada in 2017.</p>
<p><strong>Stiff Person Syndrome</strong></p>
<p>Tina Ceroni’s story is much more personal. She is only the second person in the world to have received an experimental stem cell treatment for Stiff Person Syndrome, a rare neurologic condition that causes uncontrolled and sustained contractions of the arm, leg or other muscles. Often misdiagnosed initially as Multiple Sclerosis or anxiety/depression, SPS is also an autoimmune disease for which the cause is unknown.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_10026" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/our-stories_tina.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-10026" src="https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/our-stories_tina.jpg?w=676" alt="Tina Ceroni" srcset="https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/our-stories_tina.jpg 225w, https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/our-stories_tina.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Tina Ceroni (The Ottawa Hospital)</p></div>
<p>I’ve <a href="https://oirmexpression.ca/unlocking-stiff-person-syndrome-2c7431246f6e#.oym373qfs" target="_blank">written about Tina’s story before</a> – about how she was hospitalized 47 times in one year and how a chance meeting with another SPS patient propelled Ceroni on a journey that included an intensive stem cell therapy under the guidance of Dr. Harry Atkins at the Ottawa Hospital, in which her blood stem cells were harvested from her bone marrow and used to repopulate her system after her immune system was wiped clean with chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Now a stem cell advocate, Ceroni’s story keeps getting better – not merely in how powerfully and passionately she tells it, but in the continued good health she enjoys after her treatment and in her efforts to <a href="http://www.shareacell.com/" target="_blank">share it more broadly</a>.</p>
<p>Most importantly, she drives home a key message:</p>
<blockquote><p>“My story underscores the importance of clinical trials&#8230;. My experience will help to change the future for others. I am living proof that a clinical trial for stem cell therapy can have a life-changing outcome.”</p>
<p>“Often hope is the only medicine we have.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s important that patients like Ceroni continue share their story, not just with the research community to give a human face to the work they do, but to show that solid research is making an impact, one that can be measured in lives saved.</p>

<p>Scientists are trying to find ways to treat cancer patients that have undergone myelosuppressive therapies, as well as patients that need bone marrow transplants to replace their own bone marrow that’s been damaged or removed. One possible solution is boosting the regenerative capacity of HSCs. Transplanting HSCs that are specially primed to reproduce rapidly into cells of the immune system could improve the outcome of bone marrow transplants in patients.</p>
<p><strong>Deleting Grb10 boost blood stem cell regeneration</strong></p>
<p>A CIRM-funded team from UCLA has identified a single gene that can be manipulated to boost HSC regeneration in mice. The study, which was published in <em><a href="deletion%20of%20the%20imprinted%20gene%20grb10%20promotes" target="_blank">Cell Reports</a></em>, found that deleting or turning off expression of an imprinted gene called Grb10 in HSCs caused these blood stem cells to reproduce more robustly after being transplanted into mice that had their bone marrow removed.</p>
<p>I just used another big word in that last paragraph, so let me explain. An imprinted gene is a gene that is expressed or activated based on which parent it was inherited from. Typically, you receive one copy of a gene from your mother and one from your father and both are expressed – a process called Mendelian inheritance. But imprinted genes are different – they are marked with specific epigenetic tags that silence their expression in the sperm or egg cells of the parents. Thus if you inherited an imprinted gene from your mother, the other copy of that gene from your father would be expressed and vice versa.</p>
<p>Scientists have discovered that imprinted genes are important for human development and also for directing what cell types adult stem cells like HSCs develop into. The team from UCLA was interested in answering a different question: are imprinted genes involved in determining the function of HSCs? They compared two different populations of HSCs derived from mouse bone marrow: a normal, healthy population and HSCs exposed to total body irradiation (TBI), which destroys the immune system. They discovered that the expression of an imprinted gene called Grb10 was dramatically higher in HSCs exposed to TBI compared to healthy HSCs.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_10020" style="width: 238px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/screen-shot-2016-11-02-at-11-29-47-am.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-10020" src="https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/screen-shot-2016-11-02-at-11-29-47-am.png?w=676" alt="Cell Reports" srcset="https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/screen-shot-2016-11-02-at-11-29-47-am.png 228w, https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/screen-shot-2016-11-02-at-11-29-47-am.png?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 228px) 100vw, 228px"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Deleting Grb10  increases blood stem cell regeneration in the bone marrow of irradiated mice (bottom) compared to normal mice (top). Cell Reports</p></div>
<p>Because Grb10 is an imprinted gene, the scientists deleted either the paternal or maternal copy of that gene in mice. While deleting the paternal Grb10 gene had no effect on the function of HSCs, maternal deletion dramatically boosted the capacity of HSCs to divide and make more copies of themselves. Without the maternal copy of Grb10, HSCs were able to regenerate at a much faster scale than normal HSCs.</p>
<p>To further prove their point, the team transplanted normal HSCs and HSCs that lacked Grb10 into TBI or fully irradiated mice. HSCs that lacked Grb10 were able to regenerate themselves and produce other immune cells more robustly 20 weeks after transplantation compared to normal HSCs.</p>
<p><strong>Potential applications and future studies</strong></p>
<p>This study offers two important findings. First, they discovered that Grb10 plays an important role “in regulating HSC self-renewal following transplantation and HSC regeneration in response to injury.” Second, they found that inhibiting Grb10 function in HSCs could have potential therapeutic applications for boosting “hematopoietic regeneration in the setting of HSC transplantation or following myelosuppressive injury.” Patients in need of bone marrow transplants could potentially receive more benefit from transplants of HSCs that don’t express the Grb10 gene.</p>
<p>In my opinion, further studies should be done to further understand the role of Grb10 in regulating HSC self-renewal and regeneration. What is the benefit of having this gene expressed in HSCs if inhibiting its expression leads to an increased regenerative capacity? Is it to prevent cancer from forming? Additionally, the authors still need to address the potential long-term side effects of inhibiting Grb10 expression in HSCs. They did report that mice that lacked the Grb10 gene did not develop blood cancers at one year of age which is good news. They also suggested that instead of deleting Grb10, new drugs could be identified that inhibit Grb10 function in HSCs.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10018/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10018/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10018/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10018/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10018/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10018/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10018/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10018/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10018/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10018/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10018/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/aholdencirm.wordpress.com/10018/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.cirm.ca.gov&#038;blog=68067291&#038;post=10018&#038;subd=aholdencirm&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Last week Gay and Steve Grossman got to meet the people who are working with their daughter Lilly’s stem cells. Lilly was born with a rare, debilitating condition called ADCY5-related dyskinesia. It’s an abnormal involuntary movement disorder caused by a genetic mutation that results in muscle weakness and severe pain. Because it is so rare, little research has been done on developing a deeper understanding of it, and even less on developing treatments.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_10009" style="width: 1035px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10009" src="https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/buck-team.jpeg?w=676" alt="buck-team" srcset="https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/buck-team.jpeg?w=676 676w, https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/buck-team.jpeg?w=150 150w, https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/buck-team.jpeg?w=300 300w, https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/buck-team.jpeg?w=768 768w, https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/buck-team.jpeg?w=1024 1024w, https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/buck-team.jpeg 1025w" sizes="(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px"   /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Grossmans and Chris Waters meet the Buck team</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s about to change. CIRM’s Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell  <a href="https://www.cirm.ca.gov/researchers/ipsc-initiative/about">iPSC Bank</a> &#8211; at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging &#8211; is now home to some of Lilly’s cells, and these are being turned into iPS cells for researchers to study the disease, and to hopefully develop and test new drugs or other therapies.</p>
<p>Gay said that meeting the people who are turning Lilly’s tissue sample into a research tool was wonderful:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I think meeting the people who are doing the actual work at the lab is so imperative, and so important. I want them to see where their work is going and how they are not only affecting our lives and our daughter’s life but also the lives of the other kids who are affected by this rare disease and all rare diseases.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Joining them for the trip to the Buck was Chris Waters, the driving force behind getting the Bank to accept new cell lines. Chris runs <a href="http://www.rarescience.org/,">Rare Science</a> a non-profit organization that focuses on children with rare diseases by partnering with patient family communities and foundations.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.cirm.ca.gov/about-cirm/newsroom/press-releases/11012016/patient-advocate-leads-drive-add-rare-diseases-cirm%E2%80%99s">news release</a>, Chris says there are currently 7,000 identified rare diseases and 50 percent of those affect children; tragically 30 percent of those children die before their 5<sup>th</sup> birthday:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The biggest gap in drug development is that we are not addressing the specific needs of children, especially those with rare diseases.  We need to focus on kids. They are our future. If it takes 14 years and $2 billion to get FDA approval for a new drug, how is that going to address the urgent need for a solution for the millions of children across the world with a rare disease? That’s why we created Rare Science. How do we help kids right now, how do we help the families? How do we make change?”</p></blockquote>
<p>Jonathan Thomas, the Chair of the CIRM Board, said one way to help these families and drive change is by adding samples of stem cells from rare diseases like ADCY5 to the iPSC Bank:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Just knowing the gene that causes a particular problem is only the beginning. By having the iPSCs of individuals, we can start to investigate the diseases of these kids in the labs. Deciphering the biology of why there are similarities and dissimilarities between these children could the open the door for life changing therapies.”</p></blockquote>
<p>When CIRM launched the iPSC Initiative – working with CDI, Coriell, the Buck Institute and researchers around California &#8211; the goal was to build the largest iPSC Bank in the world.  Adding new lines, such as the cells from people with ADCY5, means the collection will be even more diverse than originally planned.</p>
<p>Chris hopes this action will serve as a model for other rare diseases, creating stem cell lines from them to help close the gap between discovery research and clinical impact. And she says seeing the people who are turning her idea into reality is just amazing:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Oh my gosh. It’s just great to be here, to see all these people who are making this happen, they’re great. And I think they benefit too, by being able to put a human face on the diseases they are working on. I think you learn so much by meeting the patients and their families because they are the ones who are living with this every day. And by understanding it through their eyes, you can improve your research exponentially. It just makes so much more sense.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Over the years there have been a lot of interesting, odd ball, even a few really rather crazy stories about stem cell research that have made the news. So in honor of Halloween, we thought we’d look back at a few of them to remind ourselves that not all science is worthy of pursuit.</p>
<p><strong>Celebrity meat</strong>:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9976" src="https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/meat.jpg?w=676" alt="meat" srcset="https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/meat.jpg 640w, https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/meat.jpg?w=150 150w, https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/meat.jpg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"   /></p>
<p>Back in 2014 a company called <a href="http://www.bitelabs.org/">BiteLabs</a> claimed it was going to make  “fine artisanal salami from meat that has been lab-grown from celebrity tissue samples.” You read that right. They were going to make salami from famous people.</p>
<p>Here’s how they described the process. First they would take a small sample of stem cells from the celebrity, the kind of cell that is used to grow and repair damaged muscles. Then they would grow those cells in the lab, increasing their number to millions of muscle cells. Those are then ground up, mixed with regular salami and some spices, fats and oils until you had the desired consistency and texture.</p>
<p>Then they were stuffed into casings, and dried, aged and cured until you end up with celebrity salami.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly it attracted a lot of attention. The Twitterverse was filled with images of celebrities people wanted to “eat” – Jennifer Lawrence, ‘a new kind of Hunger Games’. It was also filled with headlines from magazines like <a href="http://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/news/a21230/celebrity-meat-company/">Cosmopolitan</a> asking “Is this the weirdest food of all time”.</p>
<p>Turns out it was more of a joke, or at least a fun way to get people discussing bioethics and pushing the boundaries – or maybe it was the buttons – of tech and society.</p>
<p><strong>Meet the most expensive meat in the world</strong></p>
<p>If that was meant to be a joke then some researchers at <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3275913/Lab-grown-burgers-menu-2020-Scientists-set-company-make-stem-cell-meat-affordable-reality.html">Maastricht University</a> in the Netherlands didn’t get it. Because the next year they actually produced a burger that was made out of stem cells.</p>
<p>They took some bovine – aka ‘cow’ – stem cells, grew them in the lab (this took three months so definitely not a “fast food”), then mixed them with salt, breadcrumbs and egg and cooked them in a little butter and sunflower oil.</p>
<p>People who tried it described it as “tough” and “not that juicy”. Harder to stomach than the burger itself was the price tag, more than $300,000.</p>
<p><strong>A mammoth task</strong></p>
<p><img class=" size-medium wp-image-9982 aligncenter" src="https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/woollymammoth.jpg?w=300&#038;h=240" alt="woollymammoth" width="300" height="240" srcset="https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/woollymammoth.jpg?w=300&amp;h=240 300w, https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/woollymammoth.jpg?w=600&amp;h=480 600w, https://aholdencirm.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/woollymammoth.jpg?w=150&amp;h=120 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>It’s not just meat that is attracting the attention of stem cell researchers. More recently a team of Korean and Russian scientists decided it might be fun to try and use stem cells to “grow” a mammoth. You know, the giant, woolly, elephant-like creatures that went extinct thousands of years ago – except for occasional starring roles in the <a href="http://www.iceagemovies.com/">Ice Age</a> animated movies.</p>
<p>They were going to take some DNA from the remnants of a mammoth found in the frozen tundra in Siberia, decode its genome, then create a functioning cell nucleus and transplant that into an elephant’s embryo. Easy right? What could possible go wrong (for some suggestions see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107290/">Jurassic Park</a>/<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0369610/">World</a>).</p>
<p>Maybe if that doesn’t work out they could just grow the cells into meat and market them. Mammoth burgers. Sounds yummy doesn’t it.</p>
<p>Happy Halloween.</p>
